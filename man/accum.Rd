\title{
  Aggregate data from a simulated cohort.
}
\description{
  Aggregate the observed number of events suffered by a subject, the time of follow-up, the duration of all the observed episodes and the real number of events suffered in all subject history.
}
\usage{
  accum(data)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{data}{
  An object of class \code{mult.ev.data.sim}, if the individual cohort has been simulated in a multiple event situation or an object of class \code{rec.ev.data.sim}, if the individual cohort has been simulated in a recurrent event situation. Note that, although the routine will work, it's probably not much useful in other contexts than recurrent event situation. 
}
}

\details{
The output contains \code{z} and \code{real.ep.accum} because they can be interesting when analyzing several aspects as missing data or individual heterogeneity, although those variables cannot be observed in a real cohort.
}

\value{
  An object of class \code{sim.ev.agg.data}. It is a list with a row for each subject in \code{data}, and the following columns
  \item{nid }{an \code{integer} number that identifies the subject.}
  \item{old }{real value indicating the time that the individual was at risk before the beginning of the follow-up.}
  \item{risk.bef }{\code{Boolean} indicating if the subject was at risk before the beginning of the follow-up time or not.}
  \item{z }{individual heterogeneity, generated according to the specified distribution.}
  \item{x }{ value of each covariate randomly generated for each subject in the cohort.}
  \item{obs.ep.accum }{aggregated number of episodes suffered by an individual since the beginning of subject's follow-up time.}
  \item{real.ep.accum }{aggregated number of episodes suffered by an individual from the beginning of subject's history.}
  \item{time.accum}{global time of follow-up for each individual.}
  \item{long.accum}{global time not at risk within the follow-up time, corresponding to the sum of times between the end of an event and the beginning of the next.}
