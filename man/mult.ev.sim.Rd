\title{
Generate a cohort with multiple events
}
\description{
Simulation of cohorts in a context of multiple event survival analysis including several covariates, individual heterogeneity and periods at risk prior and after the start of follow-up. 

Multiple event data occurs when each subject can have more than one event of entirely different natures (Kelly, 2000). Examples of this type of event are the occurrence of tumours at different sites in the body or multiple sequalae after a surgery.

We can obtain the observation time of the \eqn{k}-th event in the \eqn{i}-th subject, \eqn{y_ik}, in the same manner that we can simulate \eqn{k} simple independent survival data. Notice that, in multiple-type events, \eqn{T_{ik}} and \eqn{C_{i}} are mutually independent and, furthermore, the failure in each event is independent of the others (within each subject all \eqn{y_ik} are independents for all \eqn{k}).

\usage{
mult.ev.sim(n, foltime, dist.ev, anc.ev, beta0.ev, dist.cens="weibull", anc.cens, beta0.cens, z=NA, beta=NA, x=NA, nsit)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{n}{
integer value indicating the desired size of the cohort to be simulated.
}
  \item{foltime}{
real number that indicates the maximum time of follow-up of the simulated cohort.
}
  \item{dist.ev}{
vector of arbitrary size indicating the time to event distributions, with possible values \code{weibull} for the Weibull distribution, \code{lnorm} for the log-normal distribution and \code{llogistic} for the log-logistic distribution.
}
  \item{anc.ev}{
vector of arbitrary size of real components containing the ancillary parameters for the time to event distributions.
}
  \item{beta0.ev}{
vector of arbitrary size of real components containing the \eqn{\beta_0} parameters for the time to event distributions.
}
  \item{dist.cens}{
string indicating the time to censoring distributions, with possible values \code{weibull} for the Weibull distribution, \code{lnorm} for the log-normal distribution and \code{llogistic} for the log-logistic distribution. If no distribution is introduced, the time to censoring is assumed to follow a Weibull distribution.
}
  \item{anc.cens}{
real number containing the ancillary parameter for the time to censoring distribution.
}
  \item{beta0.cens}{
real number containing the \eqn{\beta_0} parameter for the time to censoring distribution.
}
  \item{z}{
vector with three elements that contains information relative to a random factor used in order to introduce individual heterogeneity. The first element indicates the distribution: \code{"unif"} states for the uniform distribution and \code{"normal"} states for the normal distribution. The second and third elements indicates the minimum and maximum in the case of a uniform distribution and the mean and standard deviation in the case of a normal distribution. Its default value is \code{NA}, indicating that no individual heterogeneity is introduced.
}
  \item{beta}{
list of vectors indicating the effect of the corresponding covariate. The number of vectors in \code{beta} must match the number of covariates, and the length of each vector must match the number of events considered. Its default value is NA, indicating that no covariates are included.
}
  \item{x}{
list of vectors indicating the distribution and parameters of any covariate that the user needs to introduce in the simulated cohort. The possible distributions are \code{"normal"} for normal distribution, \code{"unif"} for uniform distribution and \code{"bern"} for Bernoulli distribution. Its default value is NA, indicating that no covariates are included. The number of vectors in \code{x} must match the number of vectors in \code{beta}. Each vector in \code{x} must contain the name of the distribution and the parameter(s), which are: the probability of success in the case of a Bernoulli distribution; the mean and the variance in the case of a \code{normal} distribution; and the minimum and maximum in the case of a \code{uniform} distribution.
}

  \item{nsit}{
Number of different events that a subject can suffer. It must match the number of distributions specified in \code{dist.ev}.
}
}
\details{
In order to get the function to work properly, the length of the vectors containing the parameters of the time to event and the number of distributions indicated in the parameter \code{dist.ev} must be the same. 
}
\value{
An object of class \code{mult.ev.data.sim}. It is a list where each element is a simulated subject and each row inside an element of the list is an event suffered by the corresponding subject. The columns of each element of the list are detailed below
\item{nid }{an integer number that identifies the subject.}
\item{ev.num }{number of the event corresponding to the follow-up time of the individual.}
\item{time }{time until the corresponding event happens (or time to subject drop-out).}
\item{status }{logical value indicating if the corresponding event has been suffered or not.}
\item{start }{time at which the follow-up time begins for each event.}
\item{stop }{time at which the follow-up time ends for each event.}
\item{z}{Individual heterogeneity generated according to the specified distribution.}
\item{x}{value of each covariate randomly generated for each subject in the cohort.}

### A cohort with 1000 subjects, with a maximum follow-up time of 3600 days and two covariates, following a Bernoulli and uniform distribution respectively, and a corresponding beta of -0.4, -0.5, -0.6 and -0.7 for each event for the first covariate and a corresponding beta of 0, 0, 0 and 1 for each event for the second covariate. Notice that the time to censorship is assumed to follow a Weibull distribution, as no other distribution is stated.
